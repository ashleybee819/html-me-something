            <p>The year was 2017.  The Arkansas Razorbacks were terrible at everything. The New Orleans Saints 
                were having a rough year too.  Basically there was no joy to be had in watching sports.  
                And then I discovered hockey.</p>
            <p>The Capitals, or "Caps" as they're sometimes called, caught my attention almost at once.  For one, 
                Alexander Ovechkin, the top scorer in the league, was on that team.  The Caps themselves were a 
                high-scoring team with poor defense, which made the games that much more "exciting" (and nail-biting).  
                I like that it was fast-paced and a team sport, unlike football.  There were also unimaginative
                nicknames for everyone on the team, which were sometimes hilarious.</p>
            <p>Over the course of the year, I learned the rules of the game and somehow became overly invested 
                in this team.  The Caps ended up winning the Stanley Cup that first season, in 2018!  I couldn't 
                believe it!  Of course after that, expectations are set, so every year is a little disappointing.  
                "It's about the journey, not the destination," right?
